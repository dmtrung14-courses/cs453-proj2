Hello Batwoman
How are you?
I just heard that Lincoln is set to give a speech in Gettysburg, PA, so we need to rush-deliver the speech transcript
to Reuters stations across the country tonight so it makes it in time for the morning papers. Here is the transcript
of the Gettysburg address:
Four score and seven years ago...
...
...
...
The end.
Did you get it okay?
